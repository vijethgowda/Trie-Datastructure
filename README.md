# Trie-Datastructure

Trie is an efficient information reTrieval data structure. Using Trie, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit 
(key length). If we store keys in binary search tree, a well balanced BST will need time proportional to M * log N, 
where M is maximum string length and N is number of keys in tree. Using Trie, we can search the key in O(M) time. 
However the penalty is on Trie storage requirements.

## Running the tests

1) Insert into trie.
2) Search for a particular word in a trie.
3) Delete a particular word from a trie.
4) Display the Similar words as suggestiond.
